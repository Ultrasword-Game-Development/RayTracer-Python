# RayTracer-Python

I like making slow applications. Therefore I am making python program for very computationally heavy task :)

## Why Python?

1. I'm good at it
2. It's easier
3. I don't have enough time to use brain cells and write in c++

## How does it work?

Its not finished yet so I don't know either :)

## To-Do List

### Urgent

- shapes
- ray tracing theory
- camera
- io
- world
- rendering

### Later

-lighting, reflection, etc
